# Choose-Life-in-Christ


Robert & Kim Kiyosaki's story (homelessness, privation, destitute)

When Kim and I were homeless, it was a choice.

 

When I met my wife Kim, she was a young woman in her mid-twenties. She was on top of the world. She was a successful advertising executive, operating a top Honolulu magazine.

 

But she wasn’t happy. Neither of us were. We wanted more.

 

We decided we wanted to start our own business teaching financial education. So we sold everything we had, Kim quit her job, and we moved to a new state, and dove into this exciting adventure.

 

It was quite a choice to make, and it was the toughest time of our lives.

 

We CHOSE to break through the trappings of a job.

We had to make that choice EVERY day. And it was hard.

 

Within two months we were flat broke. When we ran out of money, we were even homeless for a couple months, sleeping on couches and people’s floors. When we had a few bucks, we bought cheap tacos and quesadillas to fill our hungry stomachs.

 

Being poor and homeless was hard. But even harder was the self-doubt that crept in during that time. Why did I encourage Kim to quit her high-paying job for this? Why did I move her away from our home to have no home at all? Was it all really worth it?

 

We fought the doubt every second of everyday, but we stayed committed to our choice.

 

Finally, little by little we grew in success.

Finally, our choice to leave comfort and free ourselves from the trap of needing a job started to get easier and easier.

 

Today, we’re financially free with millions in investments and a thriving business. But we could just have easily quit when the going got hard.

 

Kim would say to me, “A person’s spirit is that invisible power within that emerges when the test is greatest.”

 

Certainly those tough times were times of testing. And thankfully, when tested, our spirit came out—a fighting spirit that refused to quit. And that spirit is what helped us move from self-doubt to success…

 

To follow through with the choice we made… and accept the consequences and never give up.

 

Often times, we wanted to avoid pain and tough times. But the problem with this avoidance is that we never really learn anything about ourselves, how strong, determined, and resourceful we can be.

 

We chose success over comfort. We chose reliance on ourselves rather than a boss and a job. We CHOSE to BE RICH!

 

I encourage  you to embrace challenges and tough times for what they are—opportunities to show your spirit to the world.

 

Many of you have families and responsibilities that makes the choice for your success very scary. But the world has changed from when Kim and I chose to be rich:
